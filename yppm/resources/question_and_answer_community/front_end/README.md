**It seems like people can modify old npm modules to delete some files, for example, the core-js always delete some parts in its old npm package, so that you can only use newest version. You can manually uncompress core-js-modules.7z file, then move those modules into 'node_modules' to solve this problem.**

**If you can write index.html without using npm/node, that would be better.**
